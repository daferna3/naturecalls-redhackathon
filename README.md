# CodeRedHackathon2025

## Nature Calls

This is the project we created for the CodeRed Astra Hackathon in 2025 called Nature Calls. This is just a deployed version. The original version is at https://github.com/ISucc34/RedHackathon.

This project is a web-based interactive map that marks natural diasasters with a focus on Texas. The project uses API's to collect data on natural disasters such as earthquakes, heatwaves, wildfires, and flooding. The project utilizes AI by predicting the amount of earthquakes in the future, and clusters current earthquakes onto the map.
